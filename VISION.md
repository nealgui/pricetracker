### **Project Name:** Price Tracker
<br>

### **Overview**
Price Tracker is an application designed to compare the price of products from different online retailers.
<br><br>

### **What is the Purpose of this Project?**
Our goal is to provide users with the ability to compare products across various websites using different metrics, where price comparison is the most important aspect. 
Users will be able to search for specific items by name, and retrieve information such as price, description, delivery details, and images of items. 
Effectively, we want to provide an application where users can obtain a clear view of the ways in which a product can differ when it is available on numerous websites.
<br><br>

### **Who are the Users?**
The primary target audience includes customers and sellers. 
We aim to make the application simple and intuitive for the average shopper looking to save money on online shopping, while also providing further analytics on products (such as price history) to appeal to distributors looking to collect market data to help with their research.
<br><br>

### **Why is this Project Valuable?**
Customers can reduce their overall spending costs by simply looking up a single product and finding the retailer that offers the lowest price for that product. 
This will allow them to save money without having to perform all of the necessary work that comes with online price comparison, and may encourage them to be more frugal in the future. 
For sellers, the value can be found in the product analytics such that they can collect market data for products that are similar to their own and remain competitive when it comes to pricing strategies.
<br><br>

### **What are the Success Criteria?**
We can consider our application as a success if we accomplish the following criteria: 
- A customer should be able to look for and find a particular product, and after comparing prices from different retailers and analyzing the price history, purchase the item with the “best deal”. We can measure this by looking at percent saved by each purchase. We can test this with simulated users and aggregate the results. 
- A seller should be able to competitively price their product using existing data on similar products. In this case, success occurs when a seller can find the cheapest price for any item (and be able to set their product to a lower price), with a binary result (yes or no). Again, we can check whether this is true using multiple simulated users.
